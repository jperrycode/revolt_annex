                Since our opening in 2017, Taos Revolt Gallery has sought to offer a
                space for local, emerging, and underground artists to be heard in
                the TAOS community. We offer a reflection of New Mexico's unique and
                evolving cultural landscape through Taos' growing local talent,
                alongside a number of international artists who share our vision. As
                of 2020, Taos Revolt Gallery renewed its mission to support artists
                from diverse backgrounds and elevate the voices of Black,
                Indigenous, People of Color, and LGBTQIA+ people. We seek to build
                equality through a strong, inclusive and creative community. Taos
                Revolt Gallery is committed to artistic and creative freedom for
                all.

                Formerly the location of the Hulse-Warman Gallery, Taos Revolt has transformed its historic downtown site into a dynamic, thriving facility for artistic exploration. With unique indoor and outdoor areas, we enjoy hosting a variety of events and exhibits - from small to large scale installations, immersive music, art, performances, and more. Taos Revolt is thrilled to present an ever-changing rotation of exhibits. Come view the art at the gallery, listen to live music, enjoy local food, and be with community.

 <p class="fs-5 mobile-none">Revolt Galleryâ€™s owner and founder, Steve McFarland, shares his insights on creating a space for new artistic voices in Taos. 
                        McFarland - who fell in love with art in high school where he says he seemed to fail everything else -- helped tear down venue walls or find food and sound for parties. 
                        With Revolt, McFarland stepped into full-on leadership roles -- contacting artists, creating flyers, organizing catering - host from beginning to end.

At her print studio in Arroyo Seco, NM, she hand carves imagery inspired by the surrounding nature, wildlife, and the expanses of the mind and spirit.
