                Since our opening in 2017, Taos Revolt Gallery has sought to offer a
                space for local, emerging, and underground artists to be heard in
                the TAOS community. We offer a reflection of New Mexico's unique and
                evolving cultural landscape through Taos' growing local talent,
                alongside a number of international artists who share our vision. As
                of 2020, Taos Revolt Gallery renewed its mission to support artists
                from diverse backgrounds and elevate the voices of Black,
                Indigenous, People of Color, and LGBTQIA+ people. We seek to build
                equality through a strong, inclusive and creative community. Taos
                Revolt Gallery is committed to artistic and creative freedom for
                all.

 <p class="fs-5 mobile-none">Revolt Galleryâ€™s owner and founder, Steve McFarland, shares his insights on creating a space for new artistic voices in Taos. 
                        McFarland - who fell in love with art in high school where he says he seemed to fail everything else -- helped tear down venue walls or find food and sound for parties. 
                        With Revolt, McFarland stepped into full-on leadership roles -- contacting artists, creating flyers, organizing catering - host from beginning to end.
