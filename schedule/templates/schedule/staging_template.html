 <p class="fs-5 mobile-none">Revolt Galleryâ€™s owner and founder, Steve McFarland, shares his insights on creating a space for new artistic voices in Taos.
                        McFarland - who fell in love with art in high school where he says he seemed to fail everything else -- helped tear down venue walls or find food and sound for parties.
                        With Revolt, McFarland stepped into full-on leadership roles -- contacting artists, creating flyers, organizing catering - host from beginning to end.

                Since our opening in 2017, Taos Revolt Gallery has sought to offer a
                space for local, emerging, and underground artists to be heard in
                the TAOS community. We offer a reflection of New Mexico's unique and
                evolving cultural landscape through Taos' growing local talent,
                alongside a number of international artists who share our vision. <br>
                Formerly the location of the Hulse-Warman Gallery, Taos Revolt has transformed its historic downtown site into a dynamic, thriving facility for artistic exploration. With unique indoor and outdoor areas, we enjoy hosting a variety of events and exhibits - from small to large scale installations, immersive music, art, performances, and more. Taos Revolt is thrilled to present an ever-changing rotation of exhibits. Come view the art at the gallery, listen to live music, enjoy local food, and be with community.
